# Insights_From_Credit_Card_Transactions_Through_SQL

#  Credit Card Transaction Analysis Using SQL

This project demonstrates advanced SQL techniques by analyzing credit card transaction data. Each problem statement is solved using **multiple approaches**, showcasing SQL capabilities like:
- Subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions
- Ranking Functions
- Aggregations
- Filtering and Joins

##  Dataset
The analysis is based on a dataset named: **Credit_Card_Transcations**  
Each record contains:
- `transaction_id`
- `customer_id`
- `card_type` (Silver, Gold, Platinum, etc.)
- `gender`
- `exp_type` (Fuel, Bills, Grocery, etc.)
- `amount`
- `city`
- `transaction_date`

##  Problem Statements & SQL Approaches

###  1. Top 5 Cities with Highest Spends and Their Percentage of Total Spends

| Approach | Description | Key SQL Features |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | Subquery to get total spend and inline use for % calculation | `TOP`, Subquery, `ROUND`, `GROUP BY` |
| 2 | CTEs for city-wise sum + total, use `OFFSET-FETCH` | `WITH`, `CROSS JOIN`, `OFFSET` |
| 3 | CTE + `DENSE_RANK()` to rank top 5 | `DENSE_RANK()`, `OVER`, `CROSS JOIN` |
| 4 | Subquery + Fetch to limit rows | Subquery, `FETCH NEXT`, `ORDER BY` |
| 5 | CTE + `RANK()` for top 5 filtering | `RANK()`, `OVER`, `GROUP BY` |

---

###  2. Highest Spend Month and Amount per Card Type

| Approach | Description | Key SQL Features |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | CTE + `RANK()` for max spend per card type | `DATEPART`, `SUM()`, `PARTITION BY` |
| 2 | CTE + `JOIN` with max value table | `MAX()`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN` |
| 3 | Subquery to filter by max spend | Scalar subqueries inside `WHERE` |
| 4 | Temp table + `DENSE_RANK()` | `SELECT INTO`, `RANK()` |
| 5 | CTE + `FIRST_VALUE()` | `FIRST_VALUE()`, `PARTITION BY` |

---

###  3. First Transaction When Card Type Reaches â‚¹10,00,000 Cumulative Spend

| Approach | Description | Key SQL Features |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | Use of `SUM() OVER()` + `RANK()` to capture milestone | Window Aggregate, `RANK()` |
| 2 | Same logic with separation into CTEs | Modular, clean CTE approach |

###  4. City with Lowest Spend % for Gold Card

- Filters only Gold card transactions.
- Computes city-wise percentage of total gold spend.
- Uses `CROSS JOIN` + `TOP 1` + ascending sort.

---

###  5. City-wise Highest and Lowest Expense Type

- Aggregates spending per `exp_type` per `city`.
- Uses `RANK()` twice (asc + desc) to identify top and bottom.
- Uses `CASE` for pivoting into columns.

---

###  6. Female Spending Percentage per Expense Type

- Uses `CASE` inside `SUM()` to isolate female spend.
- Calculates percentage of total spend by females per `exp_type`.

---

###  7. Highest MoM Growth in Jan-2014 (Card Type + Exp Type)

- Monthly aggregation per combination.
- `LAG()` is used to compute previous month's spend.
- Filters Jan-2014 and ranks by max growth.

---

###  8. Weekend City with Highest Spend/Transaction Ratio

- Filters by weekday values for weekends.
- Uses `SUM()/COUNT()` to compute the ratio per city.

---

###  9. City That Reached 500 Transactions Fastest

- Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to track transaction order per city.
- Finds difference between first and 500th transaction date.

---

##  Concepts Demonstrated

-  Aggregation & Grouping
-  Window Functions (`RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`, `LAG`, `FIRST_VALUE`)
-  CTE (Common Table Expressions)
-  Subqueries & Nested Queries
-  Cross Joins and Joins
-  Filtering and Sorting
-  OFFSET-FETCH Pagination

##  How to Run

You can run these queries in:
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Azure Data Studio
- Any SQL-compatible interface with T-SQL support

Ensure the table `Credit_Card_Transcations` exists with proper sample data before execution.
